# Whisper End Code Base

Hello! This is the code created for a project with a group of friends. The core contributors to the code base were Luke and myself.

We spent a whole summer during covid working our hardest to get something out, but at the end covid caught up. Hopefully anyone that comes across this can use this code base as examples for what you can do with Unity and some more advanced ideas.



## Project Details

This code base includes the following

* Dialogue system that enables a fully interactive set of dialogue, with an easy to use dialogue node building system (With use of xNode)
* Advanced 2D platforming pathfinding that uses a custom editor tool and hand placed navigation points
* Barebones AI that follows the platforming nodes, up to a certain point. Does not include Ladder climbing
* Intricate gun system that allows a wide variety of combinations of every aspect of our guns (Created by Luke)
* Basic saving system that is not fully tested, but allows modularity and ease of use
* 2D platforming movement including Slide, Prone, Climbing, and One way platforms
* Level traveling system that relies of building a file that contains all connection points between every door in the game
* Player interaction which allows the player to interact with anything through a simple script add on and events (Created by Luke)
* Basic health system
